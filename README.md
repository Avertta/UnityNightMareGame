# UnityNightMareGame

  Welcome to my new project...
  
  This will be a multiplayer game but for first step I'll make it as a Singleplayer game. If you find this like enjoyable and fun project please don't hesitate to contribute it.

  I'm working on an other 3D Multiplayer Mobile Game. The main idea about this game is there is a place (office, library, school, house, factory, cemetery etc). 
Also we are a team with 4 players. This place has got some challanges in them like smoke, poison gas, fire, electricity, bee's or dangers flies. Every team member has different
role and mission because every player will spawn different spot and every player will can see eachother for short time in beginning of the game,
for example one of them can use fire extinguisher and other one can use the axe to break doors or wardrobe or etc. Then some other one gonna find a gas mask to pass through 
the poison gas zone, and there will be many features. I work as a indie then I know this game will take looong time from me but I'm ready to spend my time for this. 

I'll use Mirror Package for Networking btw.
